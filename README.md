## 1. INTRODUCTION

myKTCN is a Django app created to provide users with a digital cookbook, accessible through an account registration, __to save their personal recipes, share them with the Community if wanted, and access other users' public recipes to get inspired__.

The app allows users to filter the recipes by category or title/ingredient, rate and comment other users' recipes. 

CRUD funtionality is fully implemented: recipes can be created, read, edited or deleted from the database.

This app has been created to showcase my Full Stack knowledge, along with my skills relating responsiveness, accessibility and UX Design.

- #### MOCKUPS

After ideating the website structure and the wireframes, and after having decided on the design elements, I've created high-fidelity mockups of all of the pages to make tangible the idea in my mind and have a detailed guide to follow when coding.
